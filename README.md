## API Documentation

The documentation for the Postit API can be found [here.](https://postit-ray.herokuapp.com/api/v1/docs)

## Key Features
##### Users
- Users can create new accounts to access all other features.
- Users can create groups and add other users to those groups.

##### Groups
- Groups are communication channels that allow members post messages to be read by other users.
- Groups can be created as public and private groups.
- Only users who are members of a group can post messages to those groups.

##### Authentication
- Postit uses JWT for authentication.
- On successfull sign up or sign in, the user receives a token in the `x-auth` header which can be used to authenticate requests to protected endpoints.
For a list of endpoints that are protected and those that are not, see our [documentation](https://postit-ray.herokuapp.com/api/v1/docs).

##### Real time updates
- The client side implementation includes socket.io, which helps ensure that the app updates in real time. You can interact with the hosted app [here.](https://postit-ray.herokuapp.com)

##### Email Notifications
- Users get email notifications when an urgent or a critical message is posted by other members in groups to which they belong.

##### Password recovery
- Forgot your password? No problem. Users can request a password reset, and get a mail with reset instructions.

## Dependencies
To use Postit, you would need: 
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com) - a version control system.
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - a popular object-relational database management system (ORDBMS).
  - [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com) - Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js v4 and up. It supports the dialects PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
  - Other dependencies are listed in the package.json and should be installed with `npm install` on the command line.
  - Environment variables defined in a `.env` file. You can find a `.sample.env` file in the repository root to guide you on setting up your `.env` file.

## Installation
To get started, 
- Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/oahray/bc-24-postit.git
- Navigate to the root of the cloned local repository.
- Create a file named `.env` using the `.sample.env` file - located on the repository root folder - as a guide.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to run the application.

## Tests
Three kinds of tests have been included:
- API Server tests
- Client side tests for react/redux implementation
- End-to-end tests to assure User Experience

##### Server tests
Server side tests can be run on the command line with `npm test`

##### Client tests
Client side tests can be run on the command line with `npm run client-test`

##### End-to-End tests
End-to-End tests can be run on the command line with `npm run e2e-test`. For this to work however, you would need to:
- create a `bin` folder in the root of your branch,
- download and move [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.34/) and [selenium-server-standalone](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) binaries to the folder. Be sure to download the chrome driver that corresponds to your local machine. 
- start the api server (on e2e mode) on a separate terminal with `npm run e2e-server`.
- Run the End-to-End tests can be run on the command line with `npm run e2e-test`

If you discover a bug while testing or using app, please [create an issue](https://github.com/oahray/bc-24-postit/issues/new) to report it. That is a way to contribute to the development of Postit.

## Limitations
Currently...
- users cannot join groups on their own by searching and then joining (for public groups), or requesting to join (for private groups). This means that users can only be part of groups that they create or are added to.
- there is no difference between public and private groups. In future versions, groups type would determine to what extent members and other users can interract with the group.
